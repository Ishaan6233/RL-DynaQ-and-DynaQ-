# Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ Reinforcement Learning

This project implements Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ agents to test learning performance in a shortcut maze environment.

## Structure

- `agents/`: Contains agent implementations (`DynaQAgent` and `DynaQPlusAgent`).
- `environments/`: Placeholder for the `ShortcutMazeEnvironment`.
- `utils/`: Base agent and RL utilities.
- `experiments/`: Scripts for running experiments and generating plots.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. Add environment and RLGlue logic as needed.

3. Run experiments from `experiments/`.
